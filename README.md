## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Messaging acronyms are everywhere now. Do you know all of them?
This is a simple web service provices a simple way managing acronyms.
It is a Node.js service written in Typescript that uses MongoDB for data storage.

In non-production environments it will prepopulate fresh database with a few predefined
acronym definitins In this package 
Build a REST API for the World Texting Foundation, also known as WTF.

A sample JSON data file will be provided with a base set of acronym definitions.

We expect you to create a NodeJS server using modern best practices for API development.

### Prerequisites

  - Node.js (latest LTS version recommened)
  - Docker needs to be installed if you wish use MomgoDB in container.
  - Docker Compose to run the web service with MongoDB in Docker.
  - Postman or some other tool to play with the APIs.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

These simple instructions are the guide to get you up and running in no time.

First install packages:
```
	npm install
```

Start MongoDB server instance in a docker container :
```
	npm run mongo
```

Start web server:
```
  npm run dev
```
