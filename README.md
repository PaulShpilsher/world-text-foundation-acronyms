## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Messaging acronyms are everywhere now. Do you know all of them?
This is a simple web service provices a simple way managing acronyms.
It is a Node.js service written in Typescript that uses MongoDB for data storage.

In non-production environments it will prepopulate fresh database with a few predefined
acronym definitins In this package 
Build a REST API for the World Texting Foundation, also known as WTF.

A sample JSON data file will be provided with a base set of acronym definitions.

We expect you to create a NodeJS server using modern best practices for API development.

### Prerequisites

  - Node.js (latest LTS version recommened)
  - Docker needs to be installed if you wish use MomgoDB in container.
  - Docker Compose to run the web service with MongoDB in Docker.
  - Postman or some other tool to play with the APIs.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

These simple instructions are the guide to get you up and running in no time.

First install packages:
```
	npm install
```

Start MongoDB server instance in a docker container :
```
	npm run mongo
```

Start web server:
```
  npm run dev
```

## üéà API <a name="api"></a>

###### Get acronyms by *fuzzy* searching definitions
```
  GET /acronym?from=:fromlimit=:limit&search=:search
```
Query arguments:
- *:search* is a mandatory string what to search for
- *:from* is a mandatory non-negative number for paging describing how many results to skip
- *:limit* is a mandatory non-negative number for paging  describing how many results to return

Result is a JSON array of acronyms with definitions
```
  JSON:
  [
    {
      acronym: string
      definition: string
    },
    ...
  ]
```
Paging note: after getting a page of results if more data available the response header will contain an entry "next" with a path to the next page of results.
```
  GET /acronym?from=10limit=5&search=freack
  
  Response header (when more data available):
    next: /acronym?from=15limit=5&search=freack
```
- On success returns: HTTP Status 200 (CREATED)
- In case of missing or invalid query parameters returns: HTTP Status 400 (BAD_REQUEST)

Testing
```
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4040/acronym?from=50&limit=10&search=one'
```

###### Create new acronym with definition
```
  POST /acronym
  Header:
    Content-Type: application/json
  Body:
  {
    acronym: string
    definition: string
  }
```
- On success returns: HTTP Status 201 (CREATED)
- If acronym already exist returns: HTTP Status 409 (CONFLICT)
- If either acronym or definition is missing returns: HTTP Status 400 (BAD_REQUEST)

Testing
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4040/acronym' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
	"acronym": "TEST99",
    "definition": "Test ninety nine"
}'
```


###### Update acronym's definition</i>
```
  PUT /acronym/:acronym
  Header:
    Authorization: XXXXX
    Content-Type: application/json
  Body: {
    definition: string
  }
```
- On success returns: HTTP Status 204 (NO_CONTENT)
- Otherwise returns: HTTP Status 400 (BAD_REQUEST)

Note: *This API uses an authorization header to ensure acronyms are protected.  Currently this implementation just checks for the presense of Authorization header. It does not validate the token.*

Testing
```
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:4040/acronym/test99' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: auth-token' \
--data-raw '{
    "definition": "Test ninety nine. Take 2"
}'
```
