## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Messaging acronyms are everywhere now. Do you know all of them?
This is a simple web service provices a simple way managing acronyms.
It is a Node.js service written in Typescript that uses MongoDB for data storage.

In non-production environments it will prepopulate fresh database with a few predefined
acronym definitins In this package 
Build a REST API for the World Texting Foundation, also known as WTF.

A sample JSON data file will be provided with a base set of acronym definitions.

We expect you to create a NodeJS server using modern best practices for API development.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These simple instructions are the guide to get you up and running in no time.

First install packages:
```
	npm install
```

Start MongoDB server instance in a docker container :
```
	npm run mongo
```

Start web server:
```
npm run dev
```

Done!  The APIs are now are accessible for 


### Prerequisites

  - Node.js (latest LTS version recommened)
  - Docker needs to be installed if you wish use MomgoDB in container.
  - Docker Compose to run the web service with MongoDB in Docker.
  - Postman or some other tool to play with the APIs.  

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
